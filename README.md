## Overview

### üéØ The Mission
- The JEE syllabus is vast and overwhelming. Juggling Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, along with constant revisions, can lead to chaos and burnout. Prep Pilot is built to solve this problem by providing a clean, visual, and intuitive way to manage your entire preparation on a single dashboard.
- Inspired by agile project management, this tool helps you treat your JEE prep like a project, moving chapters from "To-Do" to "In Progress" and finally to "Completed," giving you a clear sense of accomplishment and a bird's-eye view of your progress.

### ‚ú® Key Features
- **Interactive Kanban Boards**: Separate, dedicated boards for Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics.
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Effortlessly move chapters between columns (To-Do, In Progress, Done, Revision) to update your status.
- **Secure Authentication**: User accounts are securely managed using Supabase Auth, ensuring your progress data is safe and private.
- **Persistent Data**: Your board state is saved in a Supabase database, so your progress is always up-to-date across sessions.
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: Quickly identify what's pending, what you're currently studying, and what you've mastered.
- **Fully Responsive**: Built with a mobile-first approach, so you can track your prep on your laptop, tablet, or phone.
